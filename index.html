		<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Songhao Li. You can call me Leo I am an industrial system engineering graduate. Yeah I know it is strange. What business does an industrial engineer has to do with CS215? That will be a long story. </p>
		<p>
			I have learned c++ from CS115. I like to study on my own. So I have covered a lot more topics than just from CS115. Lamda expression? No problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have also learned C# on my own. There are two applications I am using C sharp for. Unity and ASP.net. Yes, I didn't mention Unity? I like playing game. So I also "tought" myself Unity. 
			And I learned ASP.net because I thought I could get away with using Blazor. What is Blazor you asked? Go google it. I thought I was going to build a web app for a Pos system. But the plan bankrupted because the initiator Mr. CannotBeKnown lost interest in the matter.
			But still I learned a lot about using ASP.net to create Restful API and consuming it in Blazor web app.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also I learned about using Syncfusion in blazor. Syncfusion is a commercial library which is free for little users like me. In order to connect syncfusion with my remote database through web apis, I had to learn about OData, specifically OData v4. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Then I covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Git (By the way, you can fork this page from<a href="https://github.com/Leo927/MyHomePage" class="border border-primary">Here</a>), Github and AJAX(using JQuery) from a course(more like book) from Thinkful in two weeks. Thinkful is a bootcamp website that gives away a web development course for free for whoever signed up for github student pack.
		</p>
		<p>
			By the way, I learned all of the above within 4 months. That was a lot of studying every single day. I amazed myself.
		</p>
